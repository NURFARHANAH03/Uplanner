Our project name Uplanner is for students to plan their schedule for a week. 
Each students can create their own schedule which consists of tasks, events, locations based on the day that
they choose. 
It will remind the student everytime they have important tasks or events to do.
It can prevent them from missing anything in that specific day. 
As students with tons of assignments, labs, presentations they tend to forget so this 
apps will avoid this from happening.
